MicMute
-------

This gives a tray icon for application microphone mute status. It was
written as dicord has no tray icon indicating mute status. So instead
you can use this and assign a key to MicMute.py --toggle, allowing you
to toggle mic on/off in all apps at once.

The individual in-app mutes still work, but you can leave discord
unmuted and instead use this to mute in a way that appears in the tray
